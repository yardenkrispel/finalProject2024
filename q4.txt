Building a dynamically typed programming language can offer significant advantages, including flexibility in coding,
ease of use for beginners, and faster prototyping capabilities.
It allows developers to write more concise and readable code by removing the need for explicit type declarations.
This approach can foster rapid development and iteration, making it ideal for scripting, prototypes,
and applications where development speed is more critical than performance or compile-time type safety.
